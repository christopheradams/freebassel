	<p>Software engineer and open-source advocate Bassel Khartabil will spend his second birthday in prison today. Palestinian-born Bassel was arrested on 15 March last year by Syrian security forces, and has been in prison ever since. On his birthday and the 799th day of Syria’s conflict, Index calls on the Syrian government to release Khartabil.</p>
	<p>Index CEO Kirsty Hughes said:</p>
	<p><em>‘Following courageous and peaceful protests in 2011, Syria descended into violence with appalling attacks on civilians across the country – and with over 80,000 people killed over the last two years. Up until his arrest last March, Bassel Khartabil bravely continued to work for a cause he passionately believes in – an open and free internet that is available to all. In a country torn apart by violence, he is a brave advocate for peaceful change and we call on the Syrian authorities to release him.’</em></p>
	<p>Earlier this year, Bassel was awarded an Index on Censorship Digital Freedom Award, sponsored by Google for his work as a free internet pioneer, advancing open source technologies.</p>
	<h2>We’ve asked friends of Bassel from around the world to share their birthday messages to him with us. Share your own messages with us too:</h2>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">You have been away now for almost 14months, you have spent two birthdays away in a cell, you probably lost weight, got tortured, and I am sure you feel so miserable. I can only say to you, I will make sure and try my best not to let you spend another birthday away. Happy birthday please try to have a happy one, even if you have to fabricate one in your head, res assured I am lighting you a candle thinking of you. I miss you my friend. #freebassel.&nbsp;<em><strong>- Dana Trometer, friend and member of Free Bassel campaign</strong></em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">It is your birthday. It is not a day of happiness — yet. But when justice is done, and you are released from your wrongful imprisonment, all of us will celebrate with enormous happiness both this day, and every day that you have given us as an inspiration for hope across the world.&nbsp;<em><strong>- Larry Lessig, founder of Creative Commons</strong></em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Dear Bassel, I wish you health and freedom and hope to meet you in Buenos Aires at the CC summit.&nbsp;<em><strong>- Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, Creative Commons</strong></em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Happy birthday Bassel – we miss you and continue to admire your courage and await your release!&nbsp;<em><strong>- Jillian C York,&nbsp;Director for International Freedom of Expression at Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong></em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Happy birthday you stubborn kid. Wish more algorithms to unlock and a beautiful lady to unlock your heart.&nbsp;<strong><em>- Bassel’s uncle, Oussama Al Rifai</em></strong></p>
	<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em></em></strong>You and me are the very same age. And we both come from troubled countries, in “transition” they call it. And for you it is not only a country where you are in prison, it is a region. I hope leaders in your region will realize soon how important young, creative, bright minds like you will be for a peaceful future. That “shared, inclusive culture” you embrace. With solidarity, I will toast tonight for the future conversations we will have.&nbsp;<em>- <strong>Renata Avila, Creative Commons Guatemala</strong></em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: left;">We love you Bassel, I wish can see you soon and health and visit HK asap, and we can talk together and see your images eveywhere!!! I’m thinking of you everyday with my action.&nbsp;And Happy Birthday!!!! Next time we can cut the birthday cake!!!!&nbsp;<em><strong>- Jenny Hui, artist</strong></em></p>
