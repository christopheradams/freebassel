Our brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil" title="Bassel on Wikipedia">Bassel</a> is still not out of Syrian Jail Hell. He is not yet a <a href="http://freebassel.org/" title="Official FREEBASSEL Website">FREEBASSEL</a>. Our campaign has worked to bring him <a href="https://fabricatorz.com/2013/03/bassel-khartabil-wins-index-on-censorship-digital-freedom-award/">media attention</a> and some form of increased safety. What has not worked is that journalists are not writing about Bassel because we don't have novel information and/or journalists are not finding his story exciting enough without some new original sources of information. 

</p><p>
Also, today is Bassel's 32nd birthday. He was born a Gemini on May 22, 1981. This is the second birthday that he has spent in Syrian jail hell. Have you ever spent your birthday in jail, and then for a second time? This is horrible.

Rather than add more words, retweets or spamism to the topic of our dear friend, we ask only one thing today. Please help shine some <a href="http://freebassel.org/sunlight" title="FREEBASSEL SUNLIGHT">sunlight</a> on Bassel by doing some novel research on his situation, where he is located, and help connect the dots of his situation and life. If you are not in a situation where you have the resources to help with this, then please create some art, design or action about Bassel. Some people are sending happy birthday wishes on twitter. Our friends at <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/05/happy-birthday-bassel-khartabil/" title="Happy Birthday Bassel Blogpost">Index on Censorship made a blog post</a> to their readership with quotes from Index CEO Kirsty Hughes, <a href="http://lessig.org" title="Lawrence Lessig Official Website">Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig</a> and more sending their wishes to Bassel on his birthday.

A great <a href="http://freebassel.org/sunlight" title="FREEBASSEL SUNLIGHT">FREEBASSEL SUNLIGHT</a> project Niki Korth's group The Conversation Space just launched today with an open discussion about Bassel by Creative Commons CEO, Cathy Casserly, and staff. Thanks to you all for doing this!
