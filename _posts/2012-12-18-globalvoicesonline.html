						<p>Bassel Khartabil Safadi, a Syrian open source developer and pro-democracy activist, has completed 9 months in jail.</p>
						<p>His friends and family published a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FreeBasselSafadi" target="_blank">press release</a>&nbsp;[ar] on his Facebook support page earlier last week, recounting Bassel's ordeal:</p>
						<blockquote><p>Bassel has been arrested on March 15 in the Mazeh area, following an ambush by the Syrian security forces. After spending 8 months in a security prison, Bassel was transferred to the military police headquarters in Kaboun. On Nov 13, he was again transferred to Adra jail, before being transported, on December 6, to a military court: <em>Mahkama Midaniyah</em> (المحكمة الميدانية).</p>
						<p>Bassel’s political activities have always been limited to peaceful protests.</p>
						<p>The court he was transferred to is a “special court”, operating above the law. It was specifically established to try members of the armed forces[, not civilians].</p></blockquote>
						<p>Ironically, the Syrian government <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/04/2011419135036463804.html" target="_blank">passed a law in April 2011</a> lifting the country's decades-long emergency laws. According to the new law, special courts should have been abolished.</p>
						<p>Bassel has no access to a defense lawyer. Any decisions or rulings upheld by the court –and they are notoriously harsh– cannot be subject to an appeal.</p>
						<p>Bassel's lawyer, who also happens to be his fiancé, was denied information about his whereabouts or his health situation.</p>
						<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5LcBavMek4&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">Oussama Refai</a>&nbsp;[ar], a&nbsp;relative of&nbsp;Bassel's, 100 more detainees were also taken to the same court.</p>

						<p><strong>More about Bassel</strong></p>
						<p>Bassel is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Safadi" target="_blank">open source software developer</a>. He is known globally for his strong commitment to an open and free web. He was ranked 19 on <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0%2C18#thinker19" target="_blank">Foreign Policy's list</a> of the top 100 global thinkers this year.

He is one of the people behind the software company <a href="http://fabricatorz.com/" target="_blank">Fabricatorz</a>, where his colleagues are launching <a href="http://fabricatorz.com/people/bassel" target="_blank">a campaign</a> asking for his release.<br>
						Bassel latest focus was on <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Aiki_lab" target="_blank">Aiki Lab</a>, a hackerspace he founded in the summer of 2010 in Damascus. It was shut down by the Syrian government following the uprising.</p>
						<p>Bassel is his parents’ only child, and was supposed to be married last April. His arrest changed his plans and interrupted his life.</p>
