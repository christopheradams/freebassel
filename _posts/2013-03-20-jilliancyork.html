<p>Last Friday, Creative Commons, Wikimedia, and EFF hosted a small gathering in honor of our friend, <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/2012/06/30/free-bassel/">Bassel (Safadi) Khartabil</a>, who remains in prison in Syria a year after his arrest. The event, one of many held the world over, was intended in solidarity, and to draw attention not only to Bassel’s plight, but the plight of so many other Syrians being held without cause. I was particularly honored that my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/simsimt">Usamah Mohamed </a>was able to drop by; that’s him in the front center, and I’m joined by my EFF colleagues Danny O’Brien and Maira Sutton. The other folks—if not CCers or Wikimedians, or, y’know, babies—are concerned friends of the community.</p>
