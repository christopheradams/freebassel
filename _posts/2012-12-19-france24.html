<p><strong>Concerns over fate of jailed Syrian software engineer</strong></p>
<p>The web <a target="_blank" href="http://freebassel.org/">is rallying for Bassel Khartabil</a>, a software engineer detained on March 15 in Damascus during a wave of arrests following the first anniversary of the uprising against the Syrian regime. Held without trial and without access to a lawyer ever since, the 31-year-old is thought to have recently been transferred to a military prison and his loved ones fear he may have suffered torture or other ill-treatment.</p>
<p>Considered as one of his countryâ€™s internet pioneers, Bassel Khartabil is known in particular for his contribution in projects such as the Creative Commons free licences, the web browser Mozilla Firefox and the online collaborative encyclopaedia Wikipedia. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,18#thinker19">According to US magazine Foreign Policy</a>, his activities have enabled Syrians to become part of the global internet community.</p>
<p>Many web users have rallied in recent months in favour of this new technologies expert. In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF2Ml4gWqKE">this video</a>, for example, members of the Creative Commons foundation who met recently in Cairo, speak in turn on camera to urge the Syrian authorities to release Bassel Khartabil.</p>
<p>Net users meanwhile have decided to organise <a target="_blank" href="http://doodle.com/m5web7yqea9xyztq">a rotating hunger strike </a>via social networks with participants taking it in turns every twenty four hours to express support for the software engineer and to call for his release.</p>
