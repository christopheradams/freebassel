<p>Activists have intensified their online campaign calling for the release of Palestinian-Syrian software engineer Bassel Khartabil after he was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/20121217133619491813.html">reportedly transferred</a> from civilian detention to a military prison in Syria. Khartabil has been held without charge since March 15. His supporters say they now fear the prison transfer could mean a military trial and execution. </p>

<p>Bassel was transferred 2 kind of a military court. No laws r followed, No right to have a lawyer, No family r allowed 2 attend #FreeBasselMohamad Najem</p>

<p>After spending 25 days in Adra jail for civilians, unfortunately Bassel has been to an exceptional military court, with no lawyer allowed to defend him. We all fear the result of this court.</p>

<p>Friends and supporters of Khartabil are organising online through the "Free Bassel" campaign, demanding&nbsp;his&nbsp;immediate release:</p>

<p>Bassel Khartabil has been unjustly detained for many months without trial or any legal charges being brought against him.  We, the signees of the #FREEBASSEL campaign, demand immediate information regarding his detention, health, and psychological state.  We urge the Syrian Government to release the community member, husband-to-be, son to a mother and father, and celebrated International software engineer Bassel Khartabil, immediately.FREEBASSEL - HOME</p>

<p>#FreeBassel supporters are <a href="http://doodle.com/m5web7yqea9xyztq" class="">organising a "chain-fast"&nbsp;</a>in support of Khartabil, who is also known as&nbsp;Bassel Safadi. They are tweeting with the hashtag #FastForBassel.</p>
