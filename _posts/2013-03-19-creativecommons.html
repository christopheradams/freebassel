<p>If you read Creative Commons’ blog or follow our various social media channels, you’re no doubt already familiar with the story of Bassel Khartabil, the long-time Creative Commons volunteer who’s been detained in Syria for over a year. Last Friday, we participated in <a href="/weblog/entry/37362">a global day of solidarity</a> in honor of Bassel.</p>

<p>Bassel has been nominated for the Index on Censorship’s <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/index-awards-2013/digital-freedom/">Digital Freedom Award</a>. The award ceremony will take place <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/index-awards-2013/">this Thursday, March 21, in London</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/index-awards-2013/digital-freedom/">From the Index’s nomination</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Software engineer Bassel Khartabil has been held in detention since his arrest in Damascus on 15 March 2012. The Gulf Centre for Human Rights believes his arrest is related to his work as a computer engineer, specialising in the development of open source software.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Khartabil, a Palestinian-born Syrian, spent his career advancing open source and related technologies to ensure a freer internet. Internationally, he is known for his voluntary work with open source projects such as Creative Commons and Mozilla Firefox. In 2012, Foreign Policy magazine named him in its list of the top 100 global thinkers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As yet, authorities have failed to provide an official statement about his arrest, the charges he is facing or his whereabouts. Just weeks before he was jailed, Khartabil tweeted: “The people who are in real danger never leave their countries. They are in danger for a reason and for that they don’t leave.” Khartabil’s arrest was part of the Syrian government’s crackdown against the popular uprising, which has resulted in at least 60,000 deaths since March 2011.</p></blockquote>
