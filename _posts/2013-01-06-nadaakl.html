							<p>Today I participated in something called #FastForBassel, but before I tell you why I did it, read the important information:</p>
							<p><strong>Bassel Khartabil</strong> has been detained in Syria since March 2012 without trial, and without any charges brought against him. He spent some time in a military field court and faced military trial but was recently brought back to a civilian prison.</p>
							<p>Khartabil is one of Foreign Policy’s top <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,18#thinker19" target="_blank">100 Global Thinkers</a>&nbsp; <strong>“For insisting, against all odds, on a peaceful Syrian revolution.” </strong>He also gained recognition for his contributions to the open source movement and as a volunteer project lead for Creative Commons in Syria.<strong><br>
							</strong></p>
							<p>He is in danger; like the thousands who have been arrested in Syria since February 2011 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/091/2012/en/7e21be41-1afc-4739-8363-714311388918/mde240912012en.html" target="_blank">according to Amnesty International</a>:</p>
							<blockquote><p>“(…) many, if not most, are believed to have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated. Amnesty International has the names of over 720 people reported to have died in custody during this period and has documented many cases of torture or other ill-treatment.”</p></blockquote>
							<p>Bassel’s friends organized an online campaign demanding his immediate release, you can read more about it and sign the petition <a href="http://freebassel.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; They also started a chain fast to raise awareness about his plight. Anyone can sign up <a href="http://doodle.com/m5web7yqea9xyztq" target="_blank">here</a> and fast for one day.</p>
							<p>I participated in the chain and fasted for Bassel today (January 6, 2013). If you’ve read this far, then you might as well read the rest of the post for my thoughts on the hashtag #FastForBassel.</p>
							<p>My interest in online activism is often more academic than participatory. I can talk for hours about how it’s possible for people to meet online, and act online for the sake of another guy in another country whom they also met online. I’ll think about what this says about online communities and human behavior, I’ll wonder to what extent Americans and French can relate politically to a Syrian dissident, I’ll wonder about what #Bassel and #FreeBassel mean as hashtags, and what this can do for #Syria as another hashtag on the twittersphere. Then I’ll think about SYRIA as a country, with people living, and fighting and thinking. I’ll wonder if, and how, a hashtag can translate into anything substantial for them.</p>
							<p>I am genuinely interested in online activity and activism, what it can do and what it can’t do, but many disappointments left me quite skeptical about most forms of online activism/slacktivism. I don’t believe the Revolution will be tweeted or that a hashtag will save the world, Syria, or Bassel.</p>
							<p><strong>What I do believe in, is the importance of raising awareness about individual stories, to keep a sense of perspective when events become headlines, that’s why I joined #FastForBassel.</strong></p>
							<p>Clearly it’s not the action of not eating the remaining Christmas truffles that would do this man any good, but it was the opportunity to think about him for a day, to include his name in the conversation as I told people around me why I was skipping lunch. Maybe my 2 or 3 related tweets that day meant something too. Online information overload only leaves space for in-the-moment news, keeping the hastags <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FastForBassel&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#FastForBassel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeBassel&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#FreeBassel</a> alive brought news coverage to Bassel’s story. Syria is getting coverage anyway, but #Bassel and Bassel’s story also matter.</p>
							<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeBassel&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#FreeBassel</a> is a reminder of how the Assad regime works, a reminder of the reason people are fighting in Syria. The “Syrian Crisis” is becoming just another stale headline in international newsrooms, but as the country sinks deeper into catastrophe, each and every Syrian face and name are important. Journalists will make Syria a crowd of faceless fighters and nameless victims. When they zoom in, they’ll show extremist ideologies because sectarian mayhem looks good on camera. Slowly we’ll forget that this is not what Syria is. We’ll also forget that there are peaceful revolutionaries and that they are still active today, even if they don’t always get headlines. Bassel matters because news coverage should never stop being about people who have lives, individual stories, names and faces.</p>
