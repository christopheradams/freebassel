Tuesday, October 23, 2012 | 7:00pm until 9:30pm in UTC+08

It never hits closer to home than when it happens to someone you know. Syria has never been further from most of our minds for us living Taiwan except for my good pal Christopher Adams, whose fear came true when Bassel Khartabil was detained in Syria this March 2012. We will be hosting an intimate roundtable talk event with Chris to understand what took place. 這次活動CHRIS會介紹BASSEL，他目前的情況，等等， 還會享他2010年跟BASSEL一起去敘利亞的旅程。會有簡單的英中文翻譯（不用擔心，不會是我！）

"Bassel was important for bringing internet sharing ideas to the Arab world and was also important for getting internet people in the middle east to work together and he used the Internet and free culture to help get him out of Syria and to collaborate with the rest of the world.

"Think, if the Internet had existed during martial law in Taiwan, how would people have used it?"
- Christopher Adams

Up until this March 2012, Chris had been trying to secure ways for Bassel to leave the conflict stricken country but Bassel refused, saying he wanted to stay in his country so he could help his country by letting international news media and his friends outside know the truth about what was going on. We will be hosting an event to take action in solidarity to understand the conflict in Syria by understanding why Bassel gave and trying to give him a voice when he has given us so much without us knowing.
