<p><a href="http://freebassel.org/"></a><a href="http://freebassel.org/" target="_blank">#FREEBASSEL</a> is a campaign to bring about the safe and immediate release  of Bassel Khartabil from wrongful detainment in Syria since March 2012.  He is a well known contributor to global software and culture  communities like <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://openclipart.org">Open Clip Art Library</a>, <a href="http://fabricatorz.com">Fabricatorz</a>, and <a href="http://sharism.org">Sharism</a>.

<p>It is just crazy that in this times, things like this are possible, and that with the whole dream and loudness about the Arabic spring, people that is fighting for freedom of knowledge is being treat like this.<br />
What are politics for? What do militars and our own police to to protect our rights? What does Countries really support?</p>
<p>From China to Syria, but also here in Europe or USA, it is all up to us. If we want to change something we need to stand next to what we believe and make it happen!</p>
