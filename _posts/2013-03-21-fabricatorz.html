<p>Bassel, aka, Bassel Khartabil, just won a big honor called the <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/index-awards-2013/digital-freedom" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.indexoncensorship.org']);">Index on Censorship Digital Freedom Award</a> for the work he has been doing and for which <a href="http://fabricatorz.com/" >Fabricatorz</a> and so many friends (like yourself), have been supporting through the #<a href="http://freebassel.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://freebassel.org']);">FREEBASSEL</a> and more recent #<a href="http://freebasselday.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://freebasselday.org']);">FREEBASSELDAY</a> campaign. The #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=indexawards" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);">indexawards</a> is still happening, but this is a source of the information going out now. Please help us spread the news about Bassel, that he is still detained and that we need your help to get him out of illegal detainment in Syria.</p>
<p>Because Bassel is still in jail, I am in London to receive the award along with Dana Trometer, another FREEBASSEL leader and Bassel friend. There will be a continuation of the FREEBASSEL campaign now, and we will continue to FREEBASSEL around the world with even more fervor.</p>
<p>And please remember as I said in the <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/media/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.indexoncensorship.org']);">press release about Bassel&#8217;s situation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lock-up, Lock-out fails. Locking-up Bassel, only locks-out his personal freedom. By locking-up Bassel, his Syrian captors are accidentally locking-out themselves from the future. From launching Creative Commons Syria, building the Arabic Wikipedia and bringing Internet leaders to Syria, he knew that his free participation in global web communities required concrete contributions locally. For these acts would make Syria a better place. One year later, Bassel is under harsh lock-down. Now, thousands of people that Bassel&#8217;s work helped, now help him by spreading the message, #FREEBASSEL. This is what truly builds Syria and connects it to the global connected future. This award proves that his lock-up, is NOT a lock-out of his digital freedom.</p></blockquote>
