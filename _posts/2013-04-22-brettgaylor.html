				<p>My daughter turned 4 a few months ago.  We were musing over how to ask family not to give too much: we’re uncomfortable when she receives a lot of gifts. We don’t want to be ungrateful, so we experimented with asking people to give her $4.  We’d then talk with her about saving a 1/3 of the money, spending 1/3, and donating a 1/3 to a charity.
</p><p>
Tonight we discussed what she’d like to do with the 1/3 she’d give to charity.  We’d discussed inequality before - and she said she’d like to give the money to kids who needed it.  I told her that there were some places in he world at war, and the kids in those countries suffered.  We talked about Syria.  And I thought of Bassel.
</p><p>
Bassel Khartabil is a contributor to open source projects.  He is a developer.  He’s a tinkerer. He’s help build two projects that have had a profound impact on my life: Creative Commons and Mozilla.  And for over a year, <a href="http://freebassel.org/">he has been detained in a Syrian prison</a> - arrested by the government in a mass roundup in Damascus.
</p><p>
Bassel had arranged a screening of my document, Rip, in a Damascus hackerspace.  We’d exchanged a few emails.  I had a chance to meet him in 2011 in Seoul at a Creative Commons gathering, and was very impressed by him.  Humble, generous, intelligent.  We discussed a potential collaboration - we chatted and explored Seoul.  I snapped this picture of him.  I had forgotten about this picture and found it on my computer in a backup of cell phone pics.

<p>
Bassel’s curiosity is the same as mine and my colleagues at Mozilla.  He has a family.  He’s in prison for being a hacker and an independent thinker.  It’s up to the rest of us to be as dangerous to autocrats and fearmongers as they believed Bassel might be.

Layla donated a third of her money to children in Syria with savethechildren.com.  Bassel, we hope you are ok.
