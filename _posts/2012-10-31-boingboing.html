Bassel Khartabil, a Palestinian free/open source developer and Creative Commons activist, has been in prison in Syria since June, and his colleagues around the world have been agitating for his release. Now, the news gets worse: a recently released fellow inmate reports that Khartabil has been subject to harsh treatment and torture in Syrian custody. From the Electronic Frontier Foundation's  Eva Galperin:


</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 According to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/076/2012/en/50fb59c2-c31e-4a98-bd27-61c423c87b38/mde240762012en.html">a new Amnesty International report</a>, a released detainee has informed Bassel Khartabilâ€™s family that he is being held at the Military Intelligence Branch in Kafr Sousseh and had been tortured and otherwise ill-treated.
 </p><p>
 In response to this alarming news, Bassel's friends and supporters around the world have launched a letter-writing campaign, hoping to flood Syrian officials and diplomats with physical mail demanding that Khartabil be formally charged and given access to a lawyer or released immediately. Participants are encouraged to send photographs of their letters to info@freebassel.org.
