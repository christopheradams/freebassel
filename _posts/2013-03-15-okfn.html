<p><strong>On March 15, 2012, Bassel Khartabil was detained in a wave of arrests in the Mazzeh district of Damascus. Since then, his family has received no official explanation for his detention or information regarding his whereabouts. However, his family has recently learned from previous detainees at the security branch of Kafer Sousa, Damascus, that Bassel is being held at this location.</strong></p>

<p>Since then, Bassel has become known worldwide for his strong commitment to the open web, teaching others about technology, and contributing his experience freely to help the world. Bassel is the project leader for an open source web software called Aiki Framework. He is well known in online technical communities as a dedicated volunteer to major Internet projects like <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.openclipart.org">Open Clip Art Library</a>, <a href="http://www.fabricatorz.com">Fabricatorz</a>, and <a href="http://www.sharism.org">Sharism</a>.</p>

<p>Since his arrest, Bassel’s valuable volunteer work, both in Syria and around the world, has been stopped. His absence has been painful for the communities that depend on him. In addition, his family, and his fiancée whom he was due to marry this past April, have had their lives put on hold.</p>

<p>Bassel Khartabil has been unjustly detained for many months without trial or any legal charges being brought against him.</p>

<p>This day is the one year anniversary of the illegal jailing of Bassel Khartibil, well known free internet pioneer, software engineer, teacher, husband, family-man and friend. Bassel is a normal guy, in a bad situation. He is now stuck in a Syrian jail cell where he is not able to directly contribute to his local and global communities. We demand his captors to #FREEBASSEL!</p>

<p>To end this unjust detainment as soon as possible, actions are organised around the world on March 15th. The Open Knowledge Foundation supports this initiative and calls for everyone to sign the petition for immediate release on <a href="http://freebassel.org">Freebassel.org</a>!</p>
