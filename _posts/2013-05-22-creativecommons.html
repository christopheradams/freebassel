<p>If you <a href="https://creativecommons.net/civicrm/mailing/subscribe">subscribe to Creative Commons’ newsletter</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/creativecommons/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creativecommons">Facebook</a>, you’re likely familiar with the story of <a href="/tag/freebassel">Bassel Khartabil</a>, our friend and longtime CC volunteer who’s been in prison in Syria since March 2012. Today, on the second birthday that Bassel has spent in prison, friends of Bassel and members of the open community are taking a moment to reflect on his situation and call for his release.</p>
<p>The Index on Censorship, which <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37612">honored Bassel in March with the Digital Freedom Award</a>, has compiled <a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/05/happy-birthday-bassel-khartabil/">a collection of birthday wishes for Bassel:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I just want him free, I pray for him to be free and I pray for all his friends who believe and work on Bassel’s freedom. – Bassel’s mother</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It is your birthday. It is not a day of happiness — yet. But when justice is done, and you are released from your wrongful imprisonment, all of us will celebrate with enormous happiness both this day, and every day that you have given us as an inspiration for hope across the world. – Larry Lessig, founder of Creative Commons</p></blockquote>

<p>Our friend Jon Phillips, organizer of the <a href="http://freebassel.org/">#freebassel campaign</a>, has launched a project called <a href="https://fabricatorz.com/2013/05/freebassel-sunlight-celebrate-bassels-birthday-today-may-22-2013/">FREEBASSEL SUNLIGHT</a>. In Jon’s words, “Please help shine some sunlight on Bassel by doing some novel research on his situation, where he is located, and help connect the dots of his situation and life.”</p>
<p>Artist and filmmaker <a href="https://twitter.com/KikiSurvives">Niki Korth</a> recently developed a game that <a href="http://vimeo.com/65991186">uses quotations from Bassel</a> to start conversations about free and open communication, the conflict in Syria, and other topics. Niki has been <a href="http://freebasselconversation.tumblr.com/">publishing the playing cards online</a> as well as <a href="http://vimeo.com/thebigconversationspace/videos">videos of people playing the game.</a></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Niki led a few of us at CC in the game. You can watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/thebigconversationspace/videos">our responses</a> to several of her questions on her Vimeo page.</p>
